**In this project We will use MapReduce with Python to do an amazing stuff.Here We will calculate total amount spent by customer based on the dataset given and also sort it by
using two mapper and reducer function using MRJob library**.<br></br>

**Before jumping to the code lets understand MapReduce First**...<br></br>

MapReduce is a programming paradigm that enables massive scalability across hundreds or thousands of servers in a Hadoop cluster. As the processing component, MapReduce is the heart of Apache Hadoop. The term "MapReduce" refers to two separate and distinct tasks that Hadoop programs perform.
A MapReduce program is composed of a map procedure, which performs filtering and sorting, and a reduce method, which performs a summary operation.


**Important Note: Go through the customer-orders.csv file before jumping to the code.**

**So what are you waiting for...? Jump to the code to get started. As usual for any doubt or query see you in pull request section üòÅüòÇ. Thanks!**
